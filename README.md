# High-Performance Monitoring with Netdata

##  Overview
This project sets up **Netdata**, a powerful real-time monitoring tool, to track system performance for high-performance applications. It provides **live metrics, anomaly detection, and business impact insights** to ensure optimal system performance.

##  Features
- **Real-time performance monitoring** (CPU, memory, disk, network, etc.).
- **Alerts & Notifications** for abnormal system behavior.
- **Custom dashboards** with detailed visualization.
- **Business impact analysis** with key insights.
- **Lightweight and efficient**—minimal system overhead.

##  Installation
### **Prerequisites**
Ensure you have the following:
- **Ubuntu (or any Linux system)**
- **CMake, GCC, and dependencies installed**
- **Netdata installed and running**

### **Step 1: Install Netdata**
Run the following command to install Netdata:
```bash
bash <(curl -Ss https://my-netdata.io/kickstart.sh)
```

### **Step 2: Verify Netdata Status**
After installation, check if Netdata is running:
```bash
systemctl status netdata
```
Expected output:
```plaintext
● netdata.service - Netdata, X-Ray Vision for your infrastructure!
   Active: active (running)
```

### **Step 3: Access the Dashboard**
Once Netdata is running, access the web interface:
- Open your browser and go to: **`http://localhost:19999`**

##  Configuration
To customize Netdata settings:
```bash
sudo netdatacli dumpconfig > /etc/netdata/netdata.conf
```
Modify `netdata.conf` based on your requirements.

Example settings for custom alerts:
```ini
[health]
# Notify when CPU usage is above 90%
  exec: /usr/libexec/netdata/plugins.d/alarm-notify.sh
```
Restart Netdata to apply changes:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart netdata
```
